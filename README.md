# work-day-scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a work day scheduler application in which the user is able to save events/ tasks for each hour of a typical 9-5 work day. This app was created from starter HTML/ CSS code and runs using added modifications and jQuery functions. 

## Tasks Completed

- created a jQuery function that runs after all elements on the page has been loaded
- used Day.js to display the current day and date at the top of the page
- used Day.js to create a variable of the current hour in a day
- added an event listener onto the save buttons which allows content to be saved in local storage
- incorporated a function which adds a class to each time-block, color coding them according to what the current hour is
- used jQuery to display the saved contents of each time-block from local storage
